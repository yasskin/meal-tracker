## Description

_This is an Epicodus [http://www.epicodus.com/] student  project created_

_A meal tracking application._

```
---------
Name: "Hamburger"
Details: "Didn't get a soda or cheese on my burger!"
Calories: 354
---------
```
```
---------
Name: "Fries"
Details: "I only ate half of them."
Calories: 365
---------
```

_As a userâ€¦_

_I want to log a food I have eaten by submitting a form with food name, calories and details._
_I want to view a list of foods I have logged._
_I want options to view all foods, only high-calorie foods (more than 500 calories), or only lower-calorie foods (less than 500 calories)._
_I want to click a food to edit its name, details or calories (in case I decide to pretend my fries were 100 calories instead of 365)._
